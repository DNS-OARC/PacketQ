    analysis and adds code coverage tests.

    Release 1.4.1

    Fixed an issue with the in-memory representation of DNS records which
    was not initialized correctly and could cause the reuse of old data,
    especially if the record was incomplete (such as FormErr).

    Commits:

    6a790e6 Fix #61: Make sure variables are initialized
    ed37b88 Update Murmur location
    5afb576 Update code format and move Murmur into it's own dir

    Release 1.4.0

    This release adds new fields for IP version and EDNS0 Client Subnet along
    with documentation updates, new usage (`--help`) and a buffer overflow
    check. Rework of the way OPT records are parsed has been done to make it
    easier to add support for other EDNS options in the future.

    New fields:
    - `ip_version`: The IP version as an int (4/6)
    - `edns0_ecs`: A bool that is true if Client Subnet (RFC7871) was found
    - `edns0_ecs_family`: An int with the address family
    - `edns0_ecs_source`: An int with the source prefix length
    - `edns0_ecs_scope`: An int with the scope prefix length
    - `edns0_ecs_address`: A textual representation of the address

    Bugfix:
    - `get_ushort()` in DNS parsing was not checking length of buffer before
      accessing it.

    Commits:
    0e7c34a Rewrote usage, add option descriptions, tables and fields
    3943dda Update documentation and tests
    f4b9464 Add IP_Version
    0b309e6 ECS addresses and OPT RR parsing
    875fd60 Correct type in documentation also
    b5a91b7 Damn the common keyboard sequences...
    358b9af Buf overflow check, move OPT RR parsing, rework EDNS0 ECS
    d38fffc Add EDNS option codes and EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) support

    Release 1.3.1

    This release add packaging files for DEB and RPM distributions and
    fixes a couple of bugs:
    - ICMP code to fill the tables was wrong and created segfault using
      normal select, aggregation or group functions. The code has been
      rewritten to work as the DNS code does and ICMP tests have been
      added.
    - Historically PacketQ parses all resource records but only saves
      the first and last record, this would overwrite EDNS information
      if it was not the first or last record. This has been fixed by
      saving the EDNS information as it is found.

    Thanks to Anand Buddhdev (RIPE NCC) and Daniel Stirnimann (SWITCH)
    for providing PCAPs to help resolve the bugs.

    Commits:

    9c2627f Fix CID 1439421
    5423c1d Fix #17: Save EDNS information when it's found
    ecb166e Fix #48: ICMP parsing and a little better memory handling
    0052024 Fix #45: Add packaging files

    Release 1.3.0

    First release under DNS-OARC management with license changed to GPL v3.0,
    minor version jump to not conflict with forked repositories that
    increased the version themselves.

    Software now using Travis-CI and Jenkins to compile and test under Debian,
    Ubuntu, CentOS, FreeBSD and OpenBSD. Coverity Scan used for code analysis
    and 30 defects have been solved.

    Bug fixes / enhancements:
    - Big endian supported correctly
    - Check data length when processing TCP/UDP packets
    - Support VLAN-tagged packets
    - Support for older compilers (CentOS 6)
    - Prevent "time of check, time of use"
    - Use `snprintf()` instead of `sprinf()`

    Commits:
