packetq (1.7.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.7.0

    This release adds two new columns for the number of labels in the
    query and in the first answer, and two new functions for looking up
    country code and autonomous system number (ASN) of addresses using
    MaxMind databases (see `FUNCTIONS.md` on how to specify database
    to use).

    - New column `qlabels`, number of labels in `qname`
    - New column `alabels`, number of labels in `aname`
    - New function `CC(address)`, the 2-letter ISO country code associated with the address
    - New function `ASN(address)`, the ASN associated with the address

    64d1d72 Couting labels
    b3b970d Adding field qlabel_count as the count of the number of labels in the query

packetq (1.6.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.6.0

    This release adds a new SQL function for masking addresses and adds
    support for Pcap's LINUX_SLL link layer.

    The new `netmask()` function (added by Ken Renard @kdrenard) is used
    as follows: `NETMASK(address [, v4_mask_length [, v6_mask_length]])`

    Other fixes:
    - `packet_handler`: Clean up header parsing, size checks etc
    - Remove own defines of ether/proto types and don't overlap `struct in6_addr`

    ae211e6 LINUX_SLL, netmask(), ether types
    d847c97 Adding Netmask description to FUNCTIONS.md
    4be804d Adding Netmask function.  Usage "netmask (<address_field>[, <IPv4-mask-length>[, <IPv6-mask-length>]])"

packetq (1.4.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.4.1

    Fixed an issue with the in-memory representation of DNS records which
    was not initialized correctly and could cause the reuse of old data,
    especially if the record was incomplete (such as FormErr).

packetq (1.4.0-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.4.0

    This release adds new fields for IP version and EDNS0 Client Subnet along
    with documentation updates, new usage (`--help`) and a buffer overflow
    check. Rework of the way OPT records are parsed has been done to make it
    easier to add support for other EDNS options in the future.

    New fields:
    - `ip_version`: The IP version as an int (4/6)
    - `edns0_ecs`: A bool that is true if Client Subnet (RFC7871) was found
    - `edns0_ecs_family`: An int with the address family
    - `edns0_ecs_source`: An int with the source prefix length
    - `edns0_ecs_scope`: An int with the scope prefix length
    - `edns0_ecs_address`: A textual representation of the address

    Bugfix:
    - `get_ushort()` in DNS parsing was not checking length of buffer before
      accessing it.

    Commits:
    0e7c34a Rewrote usage, add option descriptions, tables and fields
    3943dda Update documentation and tests

packetq (1.3.1-1~unstable+1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release 1.3.1

    This release add packaging files for DEB and RPM distributions and
    fixes a couple of bugs:
    - ICMP code to fill the tables was wrong and created segfault using
      normal select, aggregation or group functions. The code has been
      rewritten to work as the DNS code does and ICMP tests have been
      added.
    - Historically PacketQ parses all resource records but only saves
      the first and last record, this would overwrite EDNS information
      if it was not the first or last record. This has been fixed by
      saving the EDNS information as it is found.

    Thanks to Anand Buddhdev (RIPE NCC) and Daniel Stirnimann (SWITCH)
    for providing PCAPs to help resolve the bugs.
