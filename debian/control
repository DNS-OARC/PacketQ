Description: A tool that provides a basic SQL-frontend to PCAP-files
 packetq is a command line tool to run SQL queries directly on PCAP files,
 the results can be outputted as JSON (default), formatted/compact CSV and XML.
 It also contain a very simplistic web-server in order to inspect PCAP files
 remotely. PacketQ was previously known as DNS2db but was renamed in 2011 when
 it was rebuilt and could handle protocols other than DNS among other things.
